 A tutorial on Crawling the Web and Scraping off the Useful bits - without actually doing anything

## What is Web Crawling and Web Scraping? Are they really different?

### Web Crawling

Web Crawling is the process of going through the World Wide Web systematically and indexing it. 

Of course, not a human directly; that would be rather inefficient... We're talking about an automated bot called a Spider (or Spiderbot) that intelligently (or stupidly, depending on how you see it) goes through the entire web. ([Paraphrased from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler))

The parts that you can and can't Google, all of them are visible to these nifty guys... 

They're generally used to keep stock of what's on there and where the pages rank in popularity. 
But they're capable of doing literally anything that we tell them to do with the data they gather. 

Google, or like any other search engine, are examples of web crawlers.

### Web Scraping

A Web Scraper is more or less the same as a Web Crawler, except that it involves reading Human Readable text and trying to get a machine to do the same. It's a lot more time consuming but easier to write a Web Scraper since you'd have to imagine how you'd be doing things yourself. 

On the other hand, a web crawler requires you to be able to know exactly what you want to do without having a very clear visual idea of how things are, but are a lot easier to code once you have the overall idea in mind.


### What's the difference??? I'm confused dude!

In the end, Web Crawling is an application made for computers to do, whereas Web Scraping is a human task that is being automated with a computer. So we're definitely going for the Web Scraper here, and not the Web Crawler, although that'll also be done soon.
